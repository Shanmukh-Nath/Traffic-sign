# Traffic-sign

This project is developed to detect traffic sign objects using OpenCV Library and Deep Learning Algorithms

This model can classify upto 43 Labelled objects
Using Convolutional Neural Network I was able to achieve 89% accuracy.
There are two parts for this project

## Training
1. Training is done in trainer.py file
2. I have used 4 Conv2D Layers and 2 MaxPool Layers
3. Using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) combined with Computer Vision (CV), I was able to train this Neural Network.
